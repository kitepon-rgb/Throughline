# Throughline

Use this skill to operate Throughline from Codex without making the user type long
commands.

If the user invokes `$throughline` by itself, treat that as a request to prepare
a fresh Codex thread handoff from the current Throughline memory. The normal
path is not a current-thread trim/rollback path: it starts a new Codex thread
through app-server, injects the handoff memory as a developer item, and opens
that thread in the selected host.

## Core Rule

Do not ask the user for a Codex thread id when the current environment can
provide it. Prefer the current `CODEX_THREAD_ID` / `THROUGHLINE_CODEX_THREAD_ID`
identity.

For bare `$throughline`, do not run doctor / dry-run / preflight first and do
not ask for confirmation. Execute the handoff-start command directly. If it
fails, report the error plainly instead of silently falling back to another
memory source or current-thread rollback.

Choose the open host from the current Codex application surface, not from
environment variables inherited by the shell or a persistent PTY. Pass it
explicitly whenever the surface is known:

- Codex Desktop: `--open-host desktop`
- Codex in VS Code: `--open-host vscode`
- Codex CLI: `--open-host cli`

Use `--open-host auto` only when the Codex surface is genuinely unknown. In
that case, report both the requested and resolved hosts from the CLI result.

## Common Requests

### Bare "$throughline" / "use Throughline"

Run:

```bash
throughline codex-handoff-start --execute --open-host desktop
```

The example above is for Codex Desktop. Replace `desktop` with `vscode` or
`cli` when that is the current Codex surface. Do not copy the host identity
from the shell or PTY that happens to execute the command.

This is the Codex new-thread continuation flow. It does not mutate the current
Codex thread. Report the new thread id, open status, and any manual resume
command if the host could not be opened automatically.

The injected memory must preserve the original `/tl` memory contract:

- recent work: L2 full bodies for the latest 20 turns
- older turns: L1 summaries
- L3: detail references only; L3 bodies / tool payloads are not injected

If there are no captured turns or no injectable Throughline DB memory, say that
clearly.

### "Throughline status" / "doctor"

Run:

```bash
throughline doctor --codex
```

Report whether:

- Codex hooks feature is enabled
- Codex Stop hook is registered
- VSCode monitor task is registered, and whether `Developer: Reload Window` is
  needed to make the folder-open monitor appear
- current Codex thread and latest DB session match

### "resume" / "memory" / "continue from Throughline"

First run `throughline doctor --codex`.

If the current thread and latest DB session match, render memory with:

```bash
throughline codex-resume --session codex:<current-thread-id>
```

If the user gave a current-work memo, pipe it with `--memo-stdin`.

If the user wants to continue in a fresh Codex thread instead of mutating the
current thread, use:

```bash
throughline codex-handoff-start --session codex:<current-thread-id> --execute --open-host <current-codex-surface>
```

If the user gave a current-work memo, pipe it with `--memo-stdin`. This starts a
new thread and does not mutate the current thread.

### "summarize"

Run:

```bash
throughline codex-summarize --session codex:<current-thread-id> --json
```

Codex-primary summarization uses the Codex CLI backend. Do not claim it fell
back to Claude Haiku.

### "trim" / "rewind" / "rollback" / "context cleanup"

Default to the same fresh-thread handoff flow as bare `$throughline` when the
user asks to trim, rewind, rollback, clean up context, or use Throughline
memory, unless they explicitly ask to mutate the current Codex thread.

Execute:

```bash
throughline codex-handoff-start --execute --open-host <current-codex-surface>
```

Report only the essential outcome, especially the new thread id and open status.

Preview:

```bash
throughline trim --dry-run --host codex
```

Safe new-thread continuation:

```bash
throughline codex-handoff-start --session codex:<current-thread-id> --execute --open-host <current-codex-surface> --json
```

Report the context reduction estimate from the dry-run when present:

- rollback candidate estimated tokens
- injected memory estimated tokens
- net estimated token reduction and percentage

The estimate is `chars / 4` from rollout text, not an exact host tokenizer
measurement. If rollback candidate turns are `0`, say that this session has no
current trim savings yet under the active keep-recent setting.

Guard check:

```bash
throughline trim --preflight --host codex
```

Execute path:

```bash
throughline trim --execute --host codex --all
```

This is an explicit current-thread rollback / inject diagnostic path. Do not use
it for bare `$throughline`.

## User-Facing Explanation

Explain the behavior simply:

- normal Codex turn end: Stop hook captures DB memory and writes monitor state
- `$throughline` / context handoff: one script command builds new-thread
  handoff memory from Throughline DB, injects it into a new Codex thread as a
  developer item, and opens that thread
- handoff memory is L2 latest 20 full bodies + older L1 summaries + L3
  references only
- diagnostics such as doctor, dry-run, preflight, current-thread rollback,
  restore safety, and host primitive audit are optional tools, not the normal
  `$throughline` path
